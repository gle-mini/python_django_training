        <h2>History of Django</h2>
        <p>
            Django was developed in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison as an internal project at the Lawrence Journal-World 
            newspaper. It was released publicly under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after Django Reinhardt, a 
            gypsy jazz guitarist from the 1930s to early 1950s who is known as one of the best guitarists of all time.
